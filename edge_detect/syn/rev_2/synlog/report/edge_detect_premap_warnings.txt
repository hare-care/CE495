@W: MT531 :"/home/hbb0163/ce495/CE495/edge_detect/sv/sobel.sv":93:4:93:7|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 20 sequential elements including sobel_inst.y_c[9:0].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"/home/hbb0163/ce495/CE495/edge_detect/sv/grayscale.sv":18:0:18:8|Found inferred clock edge_detect|clock which controls 250 sequential elements including grayscale_inst.gs[7:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
